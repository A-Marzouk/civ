If you do not agree to pay the new price or other applicable charges, you may decide not to renew the Subscription before the price change goes into effect, which cancellation would be effective at the expiration of your then current billing cycle.

In addition, you agree that we have permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and payment processing firms (including any institutions or firms we retain in the future) information regarding your purchase and your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase, and to use the email address submitted by you to provide you with notices and disclosures relating to renewals and recurring charges.
